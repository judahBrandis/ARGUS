The goal of ARGUS is to create a PCB that is able to measure and log equipment voltage, 
current, and its own enclosure temperature. Another device then pulls that data using modbus 
and SCADA and displays real time information while providing important information and 
logging the data.

This is very similar to existing equipment in applications like substations, transmission lines, and 
simple equipment power meters. For example, in a substation a device might be installed on a 
piece of equipment to measure things like its power consumption. To do this, the measuring 
device could use a voltage and current sensor as well as a temperature sensor for indication of 
whether or not it’s overheating. This information is then pulled through modbus by a device in a 
safer location that then uses this data. 

Modbus is used for its reliability, ease of use, and ruggedness. Not only does it make this project 
simpler, but it’s also used in real applications all the time for those exact reasons.
